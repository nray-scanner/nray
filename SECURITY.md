# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Latest release version plus current master branch. It is a free time project and I don't have time maintaining various version lines.

## Reporting

Just open an issue. Pull requests are appreciated, so if it is an easy one, feel free to also provide a solution approach right away.

## Bounties

None, but if we ever meet in person on a conference or so, be assured I'll buy you a beer / coffee / club mate and have a chat with you :)
